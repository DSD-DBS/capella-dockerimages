# "The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS."
# Our containers run with a case-sensitive filesystem, so we are not affected.
CVE-2023-4759

# https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2024/cve-2024-47554/
# Since the container runs in a scoped environment (either locally or in Kubernetes cluster)
# a denial of service would only affect the user itself.
# This is an acceptable risk.
